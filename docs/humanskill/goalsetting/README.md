# Goal setting (目標設定)

A project is restricted on resource, time.

So we must set our GOAL and concentrate on it.

Setting the goal is the MOST IMPORTANT skill to be success.

(The second important thing is BALANCING in my opinion. We should keep the deadline, but also make things good enough so that it don't take our time to resolve problems in the future.)

Problem of Engineer: Want to create the best thing (as in our mind).
We need to create things that meet requirement **on time**.
(In another hand, problem of Dev: Only want to create thing that seems to work).

Concentrate to the goal
