# Goal setting (目標設定)

A project is restricted on resource, time.

So we must set our GOAL and concentrate on it.

Setting the goal is the most important skill to success.

Problem of Engineer: Want to create the best thing (as in our mind).
We need to create things that meet requirement **on time**.
(In another hand, problem of Dev: Only want to create thing that seems to work).

Concentrate to the goal
